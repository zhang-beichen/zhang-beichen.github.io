Hi, I’m **张(Zhang)北辰(Beichen)**. Welcome to my website!

On this site you’ll find my [introduction](/about/). In addition to updating my [research](/research/), I write about my learning process and tutorials in [blog](/posts/) on statistical modeling, machine learning, deep learning, and earth system modeling, among others. And I will also share some fun stuff and my hobbies in [hobbies](/playground/).
