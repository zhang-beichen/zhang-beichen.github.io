This is the first professional and international conference attended after graduating and joining Berkeley Lab. I will present my postdoctoral work on developing a conceptual framework through literature review to evaluate inter-dependencies among energy transition &amp;amp; decarbonization pathways, natural resources, and environmental &amp;amp; social impacts. My colleague, Tamim, is the lead author of this task. In addition to assisting with its development, my primary role is to translate the conceptual framework into a quantitative model.</description></item></channel></rss>
