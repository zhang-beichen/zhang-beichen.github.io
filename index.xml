This is the first professional and international conference attended after graduating and joining Berkeley Lab. I will present my postdoctoral work on developing a conceptual framework through literature review to evaluate inter-dependencies among energy transition &amp;amp; decarbonization pathways, natural resources, and environmental &amp;amp; social impacts. My colleague, Tamim, is the lead author of this task. In addition to assisting with its development, my primary role is to translate the conceptual framework into a quantitative model.</description></item><item><title>AGU Annual Meeting 2023</title><link>https://zhang-beichen.github.io/posts/agu2023/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhang-beichen.github.io/posts/agu2023/</guid><description>AGU Fall Meeting 2023 is coming. I will serve as a chair of the GeoHealth (GH23): Surviving the Dry Spell: Understanding the Connection Between Drought Health, which will be held from 14:10 to 15:40 on December 12. Here is the abstract of the session.
Drought is a natural disaster that can have a profound impact on the environment, economy, and human health. Droughts can lead to food and water scarcity, malnutrition, water-borne diseases, and increased environmental hazards, such as smoke, dust, and heat.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://zhang-beichen.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhang-beichen.github.io/about/</guid><description>What I am doing Postdoctoral Researcher Earth and Environmental Sciences Area Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory PhD in Natural Resource Sciences (Climate Assessment and Impacts) Minor in Statistics University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln
