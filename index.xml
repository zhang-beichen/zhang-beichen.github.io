      <description>AGU Fall Meeting 2023 is coming. I will serve as a chair of the GeoHealth (GH23): Surviving the Dry Spell: Understanding the Connection Between Drought Health, which will be held from 14:10 to 15:40 on December 12. Here is the abstract of the session.
Drought is a natural disaster that can have a profound impact on the environment, economy, and human health. Droughts can lead to food and water scarcity, malnutrition, water-borne diseases, and increased environmental hazards, such as smoke, dust, and heat.</description>

      <description>For ease of referring and checking in the future, I summarized this outline for the short course ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers at DeepLearning.AI.
Introduction Introducing the general background of natural language process (NLP) with deep learning (DL).
Large language models (LLMs) [I think here the term refers to GPT-like LLMs] were categorized into two types.
Base LLM
Predicts the next word based on the training data Instruction Tuned LLM</description>
